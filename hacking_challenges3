You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!
The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the 
hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same 
total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, SUM(IV.MAX_SCORE)
FROM HACKERS H,
(SELECT HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID, MAX(SCORE) MAX_SCORE
FROM SUBMISSIONS
GROUP BY HACKER_ID, CHALLENGE_ID) IV
WHERE IV.HACKER_ID = H.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
HAVING SUM(IV.MAX_SCORE) > 0
ORDER BY SUM_MAX_SCORE DESC, HACKER_ID ASC;
