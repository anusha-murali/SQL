Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and 
name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which 
the hacker earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

SELECT DISTINCT IV.HACKER_ID, IV.NAME FROM 
(SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(H.HACKER_ID) CNT FROM
 HACKERS H, DIFFICULTY D, CHALLENGES C, SUBMISSIONS S 
 WHERE S.HACKER_ID = H.HACKER_ID AND
      S.CHALLENGE_ID = C.CHALLENGE_ID AND
      C.DIFFICULTY_LEVEL = D.DIFFICULTY_LEVEL AND
      D.SCORE = S.SCORE GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME) IV 
      WHERE IV.CNT >1 ORDER BY IV.CNT DESC, IV.HACKER_ID;
