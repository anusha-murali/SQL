Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of 
challenges created by each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one 
student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number 
of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

/* The following query fails on Oracle, but runs perfectly fine using MySQL */

SELECT H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME, COUNT(CHALLENGE_ID) CNT
FROM HACKERS H, CHALLENGES C
WHERE H.HACKER_ID = C.HACKER_ID
GROUP BY H.HACKER_ID, H.NAME
HAVING CNT = (SELECT COUNT(CHALLENGE_ID) Y
              FROM CHALLENGES 
              GROUP BY HACKER_ID 
              ORDER BY Y DESC LIMIT 1)  OR
       CNT NOT IN (SELECT COUNT(X.CHALLENGE_ID) 
              FROM CHALLENGES X
              GROUP BY X.HACKER_ID
              HAVING H.HACKER_ID != X.HACKER_ID)
ORDER BY CNT DESC, HACKER_ID;
